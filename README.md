# Upscaling Financial Market's Performance using Deep Reinforcement Learning

In finance, trading strategies are extremely important. However, designing a profitable strategy in a challenging and complex stock market is difficult. In this work, we suggest an approach that uses an integrated agent for learning financial trading strategies and optimizing investment returns. The integrated agent here is the combination of various extensions of DQN algorithm like Double Q-Learning, Prioritized replay, Dueling Networks and Noisy Nets. We explore various techniques, such as the use of technical indicators, to capture market conditions more succinctly and model the markets. These strategies inherit and incorporate the best features of these algorithms, allowing them to adapt to changing market trends with ease. Through our experimentation results, we show that our model can be easily generalized to two very different financial markets and achieves a positively robust performance in all of our experiments.
